# SimpleEQ
A simple EQ plugin I'm using to learn the JUCE Framework and programming DSP in C++

It is a Work in Progress, I intend to add a custom GUI at some point.

On Unix-like OSes, you'll want to build, and then move the .so file to your /lib/vst3 folder (you can have it nested in a folder if you like). Then update your DAW/plug-in interface to use it.
